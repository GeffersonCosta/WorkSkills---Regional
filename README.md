# WorkSkills---Regional

<h1>WorldSkills 2024 - Regional Phase: </h1>


<p>Me and my collegue Gefferson, attended the WorlSkills second-fase (regional).
Initially, it was propose that we developed models: Hero, Enemy A, Enemy B, with Autodesk Maya, and then make their textures using Adobe Substance 3D Painter.
With that done, we started to program our video-game using Unity, which consisted a space shooter game, with enemies coming from the front, and the main objective was to eliminate them.
We had two main abilities: fire shoot, and speed.
After being hit from an enemy it was game-over, and we could try again.
