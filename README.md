# WorkSkills---Regional

<h1>WorldSkills 2024 - Regional Phase: </h1>


<p>Me and my collegue <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/geffersoncosta/">Gefferson</a>, attended the WorlSkills second-fase (regional).</p>
<p>Initially, it was propose that we developed models: Hero, Enemy A, Enemy B, with Autodesk Maya, and then make their textures using Adobe Substance 3D Painter.</p>
<p>With that done, we started to program our video-game using Unity, which consisted a space shooter game, with enemies coming from the front, and the main objective was to eliminate them.</p>
<p>We had two main abilities: fire shoot, and speed.</p>
<p>After being hit from an enemy it was game-over, and we could try again.</p>
